üîê Tips to Bypass Upload Filters

Use alternative extensions: Try .phtml, .php5, .phps, .php3, .phar, .inc.

Double extensions: shell.php.jpg, shell.jpg.php, etc.

MIME type spoofing: Modify upload requests with Content-Type: image/jpeg, even if it's PHP code.

Use Burp Suite: Intercept the upload and tamper with filename and MIME type.
